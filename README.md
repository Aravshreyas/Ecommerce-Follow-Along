### **Key Features**
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can sign up and log in using their personal credentials.
2. **Product Management**:
   - Add, update, and retrieve product data.
3. **Order Handling**:

## **Milestone 1: Project Overview**

### **MERN Stack Overview**
- The MERN stack is favored for its **JavaScript-only approach**, enabling developers to work with a single language across the application:
  - **MongoDB**: For data storage.
  - **Express.js**: To build the backend server.
  - **React.js**: To create the frontend user interface.
  - **Node.js**: For running the server-side JavaScript.



### **REST API**
- A **REST API** is used to establish communication between the client (frontend) and the server (backend). This enables:
  - **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login.
  - **Product Management**: Handling product-related operations.
  - **Order Handling**: Managing and retrieving customer orders.
