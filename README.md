# Ecommerce-Follow-Along


Welcome to the **Ecommerce Application** project!  The application demonstrates modern development practices and hands-on experience with real-world concepts.

## **Project Overview**

This application is built using the **MERN Stack**, a popular technology stack for building full-stack web applications.

### **Key Features**
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can sign up and log in using their personal credentials.
2. **Product Management**:
   - Add, update, and retrieve product data.
3. **Order Handling**:
   - Manage customer orders efficiently.
4. **Database Integration**:
   - Uses **MongoDB** to store data in a flexible and scalable manner.
   - Each API endpoint interacts with the database and serves data in a structured format (typically JSON).

## **Milestone 1: Project Overview**

### **MERN Stack Overview**
- The MERN stack is favored for its **JavaScript-only approach**, enabling developers to work with a single language across the application:
  - **MongoDB**: For data storage.
  - **Express.js**: To build the backend server.
  - **React.js**: To create the frontend user interface.
  - **Node.js**: For running the server-side JavaScript.



### **REST API**
- A **REST API** is used to establish communication between the client (frontend) and the server (backend). This enables:
  - **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login.
  - **Product Management**: Handling product-related operations.
  - **Order Handling**: Managing and retrieving customer orders.

## **Milestone 2: Project Setup**
In this milestone, we created a login page using react and tailwind css. Then we linked it to the app.jsx using a loginPage.jsx in the pages folder.
Here, we learned about the differences between css and tailwind css and how to use it effectively.
